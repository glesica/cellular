Instead of copying agents in order to copy a population in simultaneous mode,
don't just copy the population, build up a stack of operations that need to be
applied to each agent and then apply them after all agents have had their
turns.

We need some kind of time travel functionality. The best plan here might be a
way to snapshot the whole simulation state and then make the visualizations
accept a snapshot instead of the actual data structures. Writing the snapshots
to disk would also provide a nice way to save the results of a simulation.
